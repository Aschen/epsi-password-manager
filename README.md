# EPSI Password Manager

EPM (EPSI Password Manager) is a project to apply cryptographic concepts in an application to build a secure password manager.

## Goal

Create password management software, this software should allow users to store their passwords securely.

Deploy this software on a server with a CI / CD.

## Constraints

All development will be done on Github.

Passwords must be stored securely:
 - database compromise must not lead to the compromise of passwords
 - server compromise (Man In The Middle) must not lead to the compromise of passwords

Users should be able to:
 - Save a password with metadata (description, site address, etc.)
 - List their passwords
 - Get a password
 - Delete a password

The software must be deployed securely on a server. Deployment should be done automatically by means of a CI / CD.

Best practices for securing a Linux server should be respected as much as possible:
  - TLS
  - File rights
  - Firewall
  - ...

## Expected work

The source code and all scripts must be versioned and published on Github

The application must be usable at a minimum via a REST API in JSON.

The API should be briefly documented: markdown, Swagger, Postman collection, ...

The application will need to be deployed on a remote server.

A document should explain the process of
  - secure passwords
  - securing the server

## Bonus
Managing your own passwords is good, but managing team passwords is better!

Transform the manager so that he can manage team passwords.
